        <h1 id="about-main-text">America's first Japanese-inspired cat café</h1>


        <div class="textWrapper">
            <article class="aboutArticle">
                Koneko means “kitten” in Japanese, and we take our inspiration from cat cafés in Japan, where the concept has flourished. When we opened Koneko back in 2016, few people here in America understood what a cat café was. But cat cafés caught on, and now there are hundreds of them all across the US -- and countless cats have been adopted as a result.
            Located on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, Koneko has an artisanal Japanese- influenced menu, house-made desserts, plus beer, wine, and sake – and a big, furry family of adoptable cats. Our kitties roam freely around three cat-centric spaces: The sunlit Upper Cattery, the warm and cozy Lower Cattery, and a first-of-its-kind outdoor Catio.
            Koneko’s mission is to find loving homes for cats pulled from the   city’s “at-risk” list by our partner, Anjellicle Cats Rescue. The at-risk list is the last stand for New York City’s cats – they are scheduled to be euthanized shortly thereafter. At this point Anjellicle activates its network of foster homes and pulls as many cats as possible from the list. Some of these lucky kitties end up at Koneko, where they’re able to be adopted by our guests. We are humbled to be a part of this extraordinary rescue network.
                To ensure the health of our guests, our staff, and our kitties, Koneko has commercial-grade HEPA air filtration in every space, an extensive COVID-related cleaning and safety protocol, as well as the open-air outdoor Catio (weather permitting, of course). We want your time with the kitties to be peaceful and worry-free.

                <p>We love cats and want to create a safe, fun, and unique environment for them to hang out with people.</p>
                <p>We think there should be a place where people can relax, be inspired, and celebrate cats and their inner Cat Person.</p>
                <p>We believe every adoptable cat needs a forever home, and we support the dedicated organizations making that happen.</p>
