                CANCELLATION POLICY: PLEASE NOTE THAT RESERVATIONS CANCELED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF YOUR BOOKED TIME WILL NOT BE REFUNDED. 
                <br>
                We uphold this policy strictly and do not make exceptions. Please plan your visit accordingly before booking. 
                <br>
                If you wish to cancel your reservation and receive a refund, please email us with more than 48 hours notice at info@konekonyc.com. 
                <br>
                <p>We also require 48 hours notice to reschedule reservations. We cannot reschedule reservations with less than 48 hours notice.</p>

            <article class="resInfo">
                <p>You can reserve your spot in the Cattery using our online reservation system. You may book your time in hourly increments. We require payment at the time of booking -- $25 per person, per hour ($20/pp on Wednesdays).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Koneko's cattery is closed between 3 PM and 4 PM every day to feed our resident cats.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Groups of eight people or more will automatically have a 20% surcharge applied to their reservation. Reservations that are split in order to circumvent this surcharge (i.e. one reservation of 5 people, a separate reservation of 3 people) will be canceled at our discretion. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Children younger than 8 years old will not be allowed in the cattery outside of our Kids Hours, where all ages are welcome. Please do not attempt to book anyway if you have a child younger than 8 — we will cancel your reservation when you arrive and refund you. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Children between the ages of 8 and 14 must be accompanied by a parent or adult chaperone; Reservations must be made for the total size of your group (i.e. one parent and one child); we do not offer a discounted Catnap price for children.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are interested in having a private party at Koneko, please email us at info@konekonyc.com for details. </p>
